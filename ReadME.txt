TCPMagic is a simple but powerful Application.It can be used as a simple TCP Sniffer and store data to a binary.
It is input able and just need a simple string trigger from the other site of the connection to read the users input from 
the cml window.It can use colores, clear the screen or a specific line or even alter it,save and receive files and even 
store them to names, define a encoding to use, drag and drop files to send, act as a clinet or a server, only connect to 
send a file aka payloader mode, not tighten to any system it self.

Log = Will store all messages into a log file.
Save2Bin = Stores the whole session to a .bin file.
No Connection Message = Will not print out a message that a connection could be established.
Drop = Is the payloader Mode.Will run a connection as client and only send a file to the server, then close the connection after.
You can either define a file before you run the connection or you define it when a connection could be established.
On run time you can Drop your file to send into the Gui or you use the button and the application will do the rest.
